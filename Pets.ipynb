He is a rescue dog, and is extremely aggressive towards other dogs (and I will probably be asking many questions about that).  However, he has always been very good with people, especially women and children.  He gets along great with my nephews and my sisters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, however, he was diagnosed with heartworm.  He has not yet received his first immiticide injection, but he is being kept relatively &quot;quiet&quot; under vet's orders.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems to have made him more aggressive.  He is now - seemingly randomly - lunging at people and bikes when we're out on walks.  Just today, a young girl (roughly 10 years of age) was walking by us on the sidewalk, and he lunged at her. I kept him on a short leash, and when he tried to jump again, I pushed him (rather forcefully, I admit) in the chest, knocking him over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't condone violence against animals, but I was angry he would be so aggressive towards a young child. So my question is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is this newly aggressive behavior towards people a result of his lack of exercise, etc., or is it him becoming more protective towards me?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How should I have reacted in this situation? Should I try to calm him with pets and praise? Should I &quot;rain treats&quot;? Or should I be firm and forceful about not doing that again?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second question is very important to me, because my natural instinct is to protect the other person.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;\" OwnerUserId=\"3\" LastEditorDisplayName=\"user9\" LastEditDate=\"2013-10-30T19:36:21.243\" LastActivityDate=\"2021-06-10T17:59:06.283\" Title=\"What causes a dog to lunge at an unknown child and how should the owner respond?\" Tags=\"&lt;dogs&gt;&lt;behavior&gt;&lt;aggression&gt;\" AnswerCount=\"4\" CommentCount=\"1\" FavoriteCount=\"5\" ContentLicense=\"CC BY-SA 3.0\" />\r",

They like to pee and poop in the same place every time, so in most cases all you have to do is put a little bit of their waste in the litter box and they will happily use the litter box. It is very important that if they go somewhere else, miss the edge or kick waste out of the box that you clean it up well and immediately as otherwise those spots will become existing places to pee and poop. When you clean the box, save a little bit of waste and put it in the cleaned box so it smells right to them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For a more foolproof method, you can get a piece of wood soaked with their urine and put that in the box along with droppings or cage them so that they are only in their litter box for a week.  Generally, if I try the first method and find that they are not using only the box on the first day, I go for the litter box only for a week method.

       "1  <p>I have a 2.5 year old pitbull/boxer mix.  He is a rescue dog, and is extremely aggressive towards other dogs (and I will probably be asking many questions about that).  However, he has always been very good with people, especially women and children.  He gets along great with my nephews and my sisters.</p>\\n\\n<p>A few weeks ago, however, he was diagnosed with heartworm.  He has not yet received his first immiticide injection, but he is being kept relatively \"quiet\" under vet's orders.  </p>\\n\\n<p>This seems to have made him more aggressive.  He is now - seemingly randomly - lunging at people and bikes when we're out on walks.  Just today, a young girl (roughly 10 years of age) was walking by us on the sidewalk, and he lunged at her. I kept him on a short leash, and when he tried to jump again, I pushed him (rather forcefully, I admit) in the chest, knocking him over.</p>\\n\\n<p>I don't condone violence against animals, but I was angry he would be so aggressive towards a young chi...   \n",

Walking in any urban setting seems to be a negative experience, but she enjoys walking in secluded areas, such as state parks, that are away from roads.</p>\\n\\n<p>She also shows fear when there are loud noises at home, such as watching a movie at home.  The volume is not turned up to an extreme level.  I realize dogs have significantly better hearing than humans, but other dogs I have been around do not exhibit this trait.</p>\\n\\n<p>I live in a very urban area, so it is not always convenient to exercise my pooch in a secluded park area.  Is there a simple method for overcoming this fear?  It is to the point that she runs away when I get the leash, even when offering treats at the same time.</p>\\n\\n<p>I got her from a respected breeder and she has not experienced any trauma in her short life that I am aware of.</p>\\n   \n",

       "5  <p>In my experience rabbits are very easy to housebreak. They like to pee and poop in the same place every time, so in most cases all you have to do is put a little bit of their waste in the litter box and they will happily use the litter box. It is very important that if they go somewhere else, miss the edge or kick waste out of the box that you clean it up well and immediately as otherwise those spots will become existing places to pee and poop. When you clean the box, save a little bit of waste and put it in the cleaned box so it smells right to them.</p>\\n\\n<p>For a more foolproof method, you can get a piece of wood soaked with their urine and put that in the box along with droppings or cage them so that they are only in their litter box for a week.  Generally, if I try the first method and find that they are not using only the box on the first day, I go for the litter box only for a week method. The wood block works well if you are moving from a hutch outdoors to a litter box ...   \n",

Walking in any urban setting seems to be a negative experience, but she enjoys walking in secluded areas, such as state parks, that are away from roads.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She also shows fear when there are loud noises at home, such as watching a movie at home.  The volume is not turned up to an extreme level.  I realize dogs have significantly better hearing than humans, but other dogs I have been around do not exhibit this trait.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I live in a very urban area, so it is not always convenient to exercise my pooch in a secluded park area.  Is there a simple method for overcoming this fear?  It is to the point that she runs away when I get the leash, even when offering treats at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I got her from a respected breeder and she has not experienced any trauma in her short life that I am aware of.&lt;/p&gt;\\n</td>\n",

The volume is not turned up to an extreme level.

Finally, if someone rings the bell, she will bark at will until finally I must stand in front of her, blocking her view from anything, and tell her to stop.

She didn't seem afraid at all, and made no attempt to leave the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we got to our apartment I made the mistake of not confining her to just one room and I think she got a bit bewildered.

However, it was now impossible to get close to her to take her to the kitchen.

In the past, we have witnessed fights between them starting and were able to break them up: usually they start with Larry \"looking at Curly Sue funny\" - almost like he is stalking her - and Curly Sue hissing and growling at Larry. This causes Larry to get more agitated, his tail poofs, and he goes into full-on stalking mode. If not stopped, he starts attacking Curly Sue.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously we try and stop this whenever we can, but sometimes the cats are in another part of the house or we are asleep and we don't hear the commotion until it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If we are not around to stop Larry's stalking and Larry attacks Curly Sue, Curly Sue lets out a blood-curdling series of screams.

First her food and toilet were in the kitchen and if I would come in first thing in the morning she was rubbing against me. As soon as I turned my back on her though she would attack my calves, like a hit, and run attack. It happened almost every morning for almost 2 weeks in different spots around the flat.

One day they had a small (feral) kitten in their clinic that had suffered a rectal prolapse and had been brought into them after being found and (unfortunately) after she'd seen some rough treatment at the hands of the cattery's resident vet, that had apparently stitched her anus shut without anesthesia. Anyway, once they remedied the situation and repaired the damage, she was a fairly normal kitten and I took a shining to her, so after a few months that she went unclaimed I took her home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;She's developed normally and is now about a year old.

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;When I take my dog on walks, sometimes there will be loud noises that scare her (e.g. thunder, construction, large vehicles driving by). When this happens her flight response kicks in and she wants to take off running. She's securely on leash and won't get away, but I often will just start running with her. I usually try to jog with her anyway, and it's more often that I'm going too fast for her than the opposite, so I don't mind running for a little while when she gets scared like this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She also likes to run, more often when she's off-leash at the dog park or the beach, so it's not something she only does when she's scared. I partially hope that by running with her when she's scared she might forget she's scared and just be happy running.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering, &lt;strong&gt;is it okay to let her run when she's scared? Would it be better to not move and try to calm her down?&lt;/strong&gt; On the one hand, I think it might be good to let her get out that energy to help calm her...</td>\n",

However,  yesterday I kept going after she slowed down because I could tell she still wanted to play. I did this until she just wouldn't go after the ball anymore.

I was pleased because the much shyer one, Truman, was obsessed with it, I mean OBSESSED. I put it on my desk and he wouldn't stop meowing till I took it down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The weird thing is that my other kitten, Schroeder, is super playful and always attacking everything and is never shy, refuses to play with it! He is almost scared of it. He just likes to sit up high and watch his brother play with it. Is this anything I should be worried about or am I just being silly? &lt;/p&gt;\\n</td>\n",

She has an elongated soft palate, so she is a little louder when breathing and she can be quite 'bossy' or 'dominant' around the younger pup, even though she's new to the house. As a result, the puppy seems quite scared of her. Drops toys if she comes near, will back away if she comes near, just generally seems a little freaked when she is around. He will have a sniff every now and again but no longer than a few seconds and no further interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We've tried a few things, but I won't mention these to discourage any bias. We really hope this will stop, we hoped they'd be best buddies but the reality has been quite the opposite. Will this change?

I left it for 5 minutes in the kitchen to cool off and went back in and it seemed fine then 10 minutes later when I went back in it went crazy again and wouldnât calm down and was trying to attack me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;It has been over 2 hours since it happened but whenever I go in the room that it is in it will try and pounce and attack me.

So I took her for a bath in my arms: she was very well-behaved but so frightened and cried out (she is usually very quiet).

She spends most of her time indoors, but she doesn't have a litter box, as she goes outside to do her business. Since she was most likely feral, we took her to the vet to get her shots and be spayed, but they found that she had actually already been spayed. She's pretty skittish, but will meow at us when she wants to be petted while she eats. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is that when there are other cats outside, she makes some pretty horrendous sounds. The hissing is fine, but other times it sounds like she is dying. In general, she tends to appear as the aggressor, as I haven't seen any of the cats outside act threatening toward her really. What can my family and I do to help her not feel so threatened or scared by cats outside? &lt;/p&gt;\\n</td>\n",

Everything was fine until I wanted to put him into the cage for the night. The moment I did it, he started fighting and everything was like that for a month or two when I stopped putting him in the cage for the night and instead I started letting him on the balcony. During these months he was constantly demanding head rubs, running around my feet in circles, binkying and laying down absolutely everywhere, especially on my bed. I loved the fact that he looked like he trusted me staying on my bed and following me everywhere. The only problem was that he started peeing everywhere to mark his territory I think, mainly on the parts of my bed he was not staying on.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally I decided to take him to the vet and eventually emasculate him so I made an appointment.

While normally a very calm cat, catching him to put him into the box turns into a literal persistence hunt, all the tricks to get him in the box won't work until he just gives up from exhaustion and we can pick him up - but even then only with gloves or your hands will be severely cut, as he puts up a fight for his life. This is also the reason why we need to close the bedroom door when we want to catch him, because otherwise he will hide under the big bed that we can hardly move and therefore cannot catch him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This has caused him to associate a closed bedroom door with the &amp;quot;torture&amp;quot; of getting caught and going to the vet.

She has bonded with me and jumps on me all the time. I'm considering having her spayed because of the high uterine cancer risk, but the vet was worried that she might not survive the surgery because of the high stress (she is very afraid of being handled by strangers). Our worry is that she may stop eating in a strange place, before and after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;I don't want to release her because wild European rabbits have over 90% mortality rate in the first year, and PETA's research shows that &amp;quot;wild rabbits have relatively short life spans (typically, less than two years)&amp;quot;. She is happy and healthy now, but if she's not spayed, eventually she'll probably develop cancer. Does anyone know if it's safe to spay a wild rabbit? Thanks a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n</td>\n",

We figured she would come out while we slept. Well we woke up this morning and she still hadnât come out. So we left the room and went out to our living room.

So, support that he's not actually scared. BUT, he does hide under the bed. Not all the way under, but behind the comforter. It is somewhat difficult for him to get under the bed fully. That being said, he could also run under the couch if he were truly scared. And then, if I walk around the corner, he will come back, walk around the corner, and stare at me. Then slowly approaches me like he is trying to hunt me. Sometimes, once he gets to the bed, I stop chasing and just watch. Then he leaps out from under the bed and goes nuts across...</td>\n",

He still trusts me and spends hours sitting in his nest on my desk. However, when he hears or sees my brother he freaks and bolts. My brother doesn't spend as much time with Baggins, but he isn't cruel and I don't think he would ever hurt him.

Finally, if someone rings the bell, she will bark at will until finally I must stand in front of her, blocking her view from anything, and tell her to stop.  I like that she barks on the initial door ring or door opening, but long after the event is over, she is still barking; let's say, 5 minutes. </p>\\n\\n<p>Any tips to help desensitize my dog to noise?</p>\\n   \n",
       "2169   <p>We have two Labradors, a male and female from the same litter, that we got when they were two months.  They are now 5 months old.

She will normally cower and urinate on the spot most times when I call her.

They were sweet but a little skittish when we first got them which was expected. I noticed they both ate aggressively and one, Cinna, was def more dominate.

But the other kitty, Olive, is behaving more aggressively and dominant since being fixed. He won't let us pick him up or pet him.

This causes Larry to get more agitated, his tail poofs, and he goes into full-on stalking mode. If not stopped, he starts attacking Curly Sue.</p>\\n\\n<p>Obviously we try and stop this whenever we can, but sometimes the cats are in another part of the house or we are asleep and we don't hear the commotion until it's too late.</p>\\n\\n<p>If we are not around to stop Larry's stalking and Larry attacks Curly Sue, Curly Sue lets out a blood-curdling series of screams.

Pip isn't really all that important in this question, I'll give more info about him later. Faith is a grumpy cat and she is pretty aggressive, but it's more out of fear.

       "17944  <p>When I take my dog on walks, sometimes there will be loud noises that scare her (e.g. thunder, construction, large vehicles driving by). When this happens her flight response kicks in and she wants to take off running. She's securely on leash and won't get away, but I often will just start running with her.

Her play routine consists of me kicking a chewed up Sumo ball around the around. I kick it and she fetches it and brings it back to me every time.

       "29533  <p>We have three rescue cats, all three of which we fostered, a 2 year old neutered male, a 1 year old fixed female, and a 6 month old neutered male. The problem is with the middle cat. She stays in my daughters' rooms much of the day, and will sleep on their beds. She's a bit stand-offish with my oldest, but allows my youngest to pick her up and carry her around regularly.</p>\\n<p>The problem is she doesn't like me (or my ex-wife) and will avoid me. If I approach slowly she will sniff my hand and occasionally tolerate me touching her chest, but usually skedaddles after the sniff. If I am able to hold her, if I pet her back her ears go back and she will fight and sometimes scratch in a panic or bite (sometimes hard but never breaking my skin). But occasionally I've been able to rub her belly and paradoxically she seems to calm down and tolerate it. She is like this with the kids, but to a lesser extent; clearly she doesn't like being touched on the back, but I can think of no reaso...   \n",

       "'<p>My dog, Rex, is like two dogs in one. He is 2.5 years old, neutered pitbull/boxer mix, and is incredibly aggressive towards other dogs.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the house, he is cuddly, playful, and docile.  My mom describes him as \"a big mush\".  He gets along with my nieces and nephews, and doesn\\'t even bark [save the rare occasion someone walks down my driveway that he doesn\\'t know].</p>\\n\\n<p>Outside, totally different story.  He walks with almost his entire weight over his front paws; he has his ears up and tail stiff (actually it\\'s hard to tell because his tail is broken); and he will lunge at basically any moving object we come across [I actually don\\'t know what triggers this behavior; I have <a href=\"https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/1/what-causes-a-dog-to-lunge-at-an-unknown-child-and-how-should-the-owner-respond\">another question</a> about something similar].  He pulls on the leash, and essentially refuses to walk anywhere except in front of me. He smells and urinates on everything, often kicking dirt when he\\'s done. He completely ignores me, so badly that even if I grab him by the snout and point his face at me, he keeps his eyes glancing sideways.</p>\\n\\n<p>It has been suggested to me that Rex is <em>afraid</em>, or simply <em>stressed</em> when outside, and I certainly don\\'t doubt it.  My question is: how do I calm him down? How do I carry some of the amazing inside behavior over to our outside walks?</p>\\n\\n<p><em>[I understand this is a difficult question, that would require a lot of work.  I am simply asking for some first steps in the right direction.]</em></p>\\n'"
